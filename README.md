# Serveless-Wordpress-site
Serveless Wordpress architecture
I've created a comprehensive CloudFormation template for a serverless WordPress site with all the components you requested. Here's what the template includes:
Key Components:

VPC Infrastructure:

    VPC with public and private subnets across 2 AZs
    Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway for connectivity
    Route tables and security groups

Lambda Function:

    WordPress Lambda function with PHP 8.1 runtime
    VPC configuration for database access
    Environment variables for WordPress configuration
    IAM role with necessary permissions

RDS Database:

    MySQL 8.0 database in private subnets
    Security group allowing access only from Lambda
    Encrypted storage and backup retention

API Gateway:

    HTTP API Gateway (v2) for Lambda integration
    CORS configuration
    CloudWatch logging enabled

CloudFront CDN:

    Distribution with API Gateway and S3 origins
    Caching rules for static assets
    SSL certificate integration

Route 53:

    Hosted zone for your domain
    A record pointing to CloudFront

S3 Storage:

    Bucket for WordPress media uploads
    Public read access for uploads directory

CloudWatch:

    Log groups for API Gateway and Lambda
    Dashboard with key metrics for monitoring

Usage Instructions:

    Deploy the template with your domain name and database credentials
    Update DNS - Point your domain to the Route 53 name servers
    Deploy WordPress code - Replace the placeholder Lambda code with actual WordPress files
    Configure WordPress - The environment variables are already set for database connection

Important Notes:

    The Lambda function contains placeholder code - you'll need to deploy actual WordPress code optimized for Lambda
    Consider using a WordPress Lambda layer or framework like Bref for PHP
    The template creates a single NAT Gateway for cost optimization - add more for high availability
    SSL certificate validation requires DNS validation through Route 53

This template provides a solid foundation for a serverless WordPress site with all the monitoring and infrastructure components you need!
